This jupyter notebook takes two csv files as input and displays numerous statistical analyses within the notebook. The analyses focus on student outcomes versus three school characteristics: budget per student, school size, and charter/district status.

The input csv files are located in the Resources directory within this directory. The files are called schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv and contain data on schools and students within a school district.

The notebook merges the input files and cleans them up before displays various tables. Tables include:
  1. A summary of school characteristics and student outcomes across the district
  2. A summary of school characteristics and student outcomes by school
  3. A summary of the top and bottom-performing schools
  4. Summaries of math and reading scores by school, by grade, and by budget per student, school size, and charter/district.
